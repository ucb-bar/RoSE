# Overview 

Meet RoSÉ, your new way to create and evaluate specialized hardware for robotic systems! We've created a unified simulation platform that combines hardware and software, enavling pre-silicon, full-stack, closed-loop evaluation of your robotic system. 

Our tool synchronizes two key parts: AirSim, which creates a realistic robotics environment, and FireSim, which simulates the robot's hardware.  Dive into the details of your designs and discover new ways to improve them with RoSÉ, making robotics research and development easier and more accessible than ever.
