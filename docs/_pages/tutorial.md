## RoSÉ Tutorial at MICRO 2023
### Overview
We are running a half-day tutorial on RoSÉ, an open-source hardware-software co-simulation infrastructure that enables the evaluation of robotics system-on-chips (SoCs). 

Using RoSÉ, users will be able to deploy end-to-end simulations of a robotics SoC running in a simulated environment. By co-simulating a cycle-exact RTL simulation with a robotics simulator, users can evaluate the performance of their SoC, capturing performance metrics of both CPU cores and hardware accelerators, and gain system level insights about architectural choices. Users will also be able to evaluate how their SoC can perform in differing maps, sensor configurations, and tasks by using Unreal Engine and AirSim to construct a robot's simulated environment. Finally, users will be able to explore different software choices for their robotics application, including both DNN-based and classical robotics workloads. 

By completing this tutorial, users will be able to use RoSÉ to evaluate the end-to-end performance of their robotics SoC through customized experiments.

A tentative schedule is available below.
